### Perceptron

Two types of Point objects were created to create linearly separable dataset. It can get type -1 (red Point) or +1 (blue Point).
In order for the points to be placed on the plane and to be separated linearly, X and Y values are derived from the function that allows the separator to be formed at the appropriate points according to the position of the separator.
Our randomly selected separator on the plane is black.
The iterations that Perceptron converges are shown by creating separator in green.
The final result after the last iteration is indicated by a separator in green color by forming the breakpoints.
The data of the points are shown as extra in the table. The iteration rate can be increased or decreased, so iterations can be seen as desired.

#### Notes:
Project can be run on both node.js back-end and browser client-side, it's ready for heroku deploy Logs will flow on html page for per iteration.
Project has a nice commenting over methods, can be investigated easily.
